- No literal tokens in generated configs.
- No telemetry by default.
- No hosted execution in the MVP.

## Scope Limits

Cursor, Aider, Copilot, hosted gateways, enterprise RBAC, SIEM integrations, and custom sandbox runtimes are out of scope unless an approved spec adds them.

## Completion Checklist

- Run tests.
- Run golden tests when generated files change.
- Run doctor/check once available.
- Review the implementation against the relevant spec.
- List remaining risks or TODOs.
